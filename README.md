# INVESTIGATE A RELATIONAL DATABASE 


Sakila movie is an online dvd rental company with a database. The sakila movie database is a relational database. This project investigates the relational database and analyzes data from it. This project was created on March 21, 2022. This README.md file was created April, 2022. 
(Note: One quirk you may notice as you explore this "fake" database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all fro2007. Don't worry about this.)


# DESCRIPTION 


This project is an SQL project that uses filters and aggregations in SQL to produce good visualizations. All filtering and aggregations were done using SQL queries. The visualizations were done using excel. The entity realationship diagram is a useful supporting material used in writing the queries. The database was queried to gain an understanding of the customer base. This project answers interesting questions such as:

- [] what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups 
- [] how they compare on payment earnings 
- [] how the stores compare in their performance to give information on the various categories of movies
